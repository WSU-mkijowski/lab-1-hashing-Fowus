# Lab 1 : CEG 3400 Intro to Cyber Security

## Name:Felix Owusu Agyemang

### Task 1: Hashing

**Reminder Deliverable:** Is your `salted-data.csv` in this repository?

Answer the following in this file:

* How many unique users are in the data? 43
* How many salts did you create? 43
* How many possible combinations will I need to try to figure out the secret ID
  of all students (assume I know all potential secret IDs and have your 
  `salted-data.csv`)
* Instead of salts, if you were to use a nonce (unique number for each hashed
  field) how many possible combinations would I need to try?
* Given the above, if this quiz data were *actual* class data, say for example
  your final exam, how would you store this dataset?  Why?

```bash
please put any cool bash one-liners or other piped commands you
learned/struggled with for task 1 here
```

### Task 2: Crypto Mining

**Reminder Deliverable:** Is your "mining" code in this repository (`mining/`)? Yes 
**Reminder Deliverable:** Is your nonce + word combos in `coins.txt`? Yes

Answer the following:

* Paste your ***nonce+word(s) and hash(s)*** below ( either 3x `000` hashes or 1x `0000`
hash)

```

* How many words were in your dictionary? 14
* How many nonces did your code iterate over? 31,231
* What was the maximum number of hashes your code *could* compute given the above? Approximately 139,999,860
* What did you think about Task 2? Task 2 was challenging but interesting. I initially tried manually searching for nonces but quickly realized it would take forever. I then wrote a for-loop script that efficiently generated the nonces for each word. Overall, it was tougher than I expected, but a great learning experience.
* Is there a better way than brute force to attempt to get higher valued coins? No, Brute force remains the only correct method
* Why or why not? Brute force is the only way to find valid hashes because SHA256 produces unpredictable outputs. Thereâ€™s no way to guess a nonce and word that will give leading zeros, so we have to try different combinations one by one until we find a match.
